# âš¡ BDSS Energy Optimizer

BDSS Energy Optimizer is an interactive **Business Decision Support System** built with **Streamlit** to plan cost-efficient daily energy usage under electricity price uncertainty.  
It uses **stochastic optimization** with scenario-based price data to generate an optimal base schedule and scenario-specific adjustments, considering operational constraints and risk preferences.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload **Excel files** containing multiple price scenarios with probabilities.
- **Advanced parameters**: smoothness penalty, ramp limits, minimum base coverage, price sensitivity, CVaR confidence, robustness weight, and real-time flexibility.
- **Preset strategies** for:
  - Cost Minimization
  - Smooth Operation
  - Risk Averse
  - Balanced
- **Interactive visualizations**:
  - Base vs adjusted schedules with price overlay
  - Heatmap of scenario adjustments
  - Scenario cost comparison charts
- **Risk metrics**: Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), Worst-case cost.
- **Detailed tables**:
  - Baseline vs Optimized cost and savings (Table 6.1)
  - Scenario probabilities, costs, and expected cost (Table 6.2)
